# Asmimick compiler implementation in bash
This is an Asmimick compiler implementation in bash, not optimized for efficiency,
speed, being multi platform, literally optimized for nothing, i just
made it because i wanted to learn assembly, x86 linux assembly that is.

## Upsides
- Hand optimized standard library written in assembly
- Can access up to 4,294,967,296 BYTES OF MEMORY!
- Emits assembly

## Downsides
- Has no standard compiler parts like a lexer, parser...
- Can access up to 4,294,967,296 bytes of memory only
- Is overall shite
