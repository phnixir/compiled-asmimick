; my first asmimick program
; the latest update lets you input more bytes than needed
; for example "test" which is 4 bytes doesnt need to be exact
; it just needs to be exact or more than 4 and under 256
; before every print instruction the data mode has to be
; set to text and after it to make sure the program runs smoothly
; and ends the data mode should be switched back to instructions
; otherwise undefined behaviour

; the latest update made asmimick compile to 32bit linux elf
; removed the dmode instruction and the requirement to specify
; some kind of buffer size for the string
; the asmimick compiler is also written in bash, uses nasm as backend
; and emits x86_32 assembly using linux kernel syscalls and including
; a soon-to-expand stdlib which is also written in x86_32 assembly
